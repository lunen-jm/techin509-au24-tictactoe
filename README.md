# Tic Tac Toe

Here are the instructions for running the Tic Tac Toe game:

* Run the game.py file
* This game has two human players for it. The first will always be X, the second O
* For each player, all you have to do is type the row and column for the piece like this `1,2`
* Note that this game is zero-indexed so the first column is column 0, and vice versa
